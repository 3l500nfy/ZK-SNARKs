# Pollard's Rho Algorithm for Factoring Integers

This project implements Pollard's rho algorithm for factoring integers in Python. Pollard's rho algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm used to find non-trivial factors of composite integers efficiently.

## Usage

To use this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
3 Run . Personally I used Jupyter Notebook,
